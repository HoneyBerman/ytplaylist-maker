# Youtube Playlist Maker
This is a Flask App for making your favourite playlist on Youtube. 

* Just put your search term(s) separated by a comma, and you will get your playlist. 

* Try it here: https://ytplaylist-maker.herokuapp.com/

* The app is made using Flask in Python along with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. 

* One of its good things is that, unlike some other projects, it does not use any rate-limiting API and has been made without the Youtube API.

* For Mobile users: It's best viewed in Portrait Mode due to the behaviour of iframe.
