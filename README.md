* The app is made using Flask in Python along with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. 

* One of its good things is that, unlike some other projects, it does not use any rate-limiting API and has been made without the Youtube API.

* For Mobile users: It's best viewed in Portrait Mode due to the behaviour of iframe.
